Introduction to Cloud Security: Securing AWS EC2 Instances
This repository provides a hands-on project to learn how to secure AWS EC2 instances effectively. It covers essential concepts and practical exercises to help you launch, connect to, harden, and monitor EC2 instances using AWS security best practices.

Key Highlights
Learn to set up security groups to manage network access.

Configure SSH key pairs for secure instance login.

Apply system updates and configure SSH settings to disable root login and enforce key-based authentication.

Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor your instances and set alarms.

Practice managing users and permissions to enhance instance security.

Pre-requisites
Basic understanding of cloud computing.

An AWS account (free tier available).

Basic knowledge of command-line interface (CLI).

Tools Required
AWS Management Console access.

AWS CLI installed on your local machine.

SSH client (OpenSSH, PuTTY, etc.).

Exercises Overview
Launch an EC2 Instance: Create and launch an instance with secure SSH access using a new key pair and custom security group.

Connect to Your EC2 Instance: Use SSH to securely connect to your instance using the downloaded key pair.

Update and Secure Your Instance: Apply system updates, create a new user with sudo privileges, and configure SSH settings to restrict root access and enforce key authentication.

Configure Security Groups: Refine inbound SSH rules to allow access only from your IP, enhancing firewall controls.

Set Up CloudWatch Monitoring: Create CloudWatch alarms to monitor instance metrics and receive notifications for performance issues.

Conclusion
By completing these exercises, you acquire critical skills to secure and manage AWS EC2 instances, ensuring your cloud workloads are protected and resilient.
